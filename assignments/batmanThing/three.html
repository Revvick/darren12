	<p>After asking if he is ready, Batman reengages the inmates alongside Joker. Together, they beat them down. As this happens the monologue talks about how recently people have taken to defining Gotham as being Batman, or Batmans city.</p>
	<p>The story jumps ahead to a meeting between Batman and Commisioner Gordon. Gordon asks Batman about the riot and what started it and he explains that a guard named Matthews was corrupt and released the inmates in order to stop Batman from apprehending him.</p>
	<p>When Gordon asks Batman how he found out Matthews was corrupt batman replies by saying that he had a man on the inside.Gordon makes a remark about how there's how he figures that everyone is corruptable, but Batman disagrees with the statement. When Gordon asks about whether or not Batman really was working with the Joker to fight the inmates (he saw the fight via security footage) Batman tells him that he <a href="four.html">didn't.</a></p>
