	<p>Harvey makes a remark about how the circumstances almost make him feel bad for Wayne and when asked to elaborate he explains how people like Wayne don't get how Gotham works like him and Batman, and that he can talk about what Gotham is, and was, and will be all he wants but that it truely is a mystery above anything else.
