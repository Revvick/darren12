	<p>As the fight progresses, he mentions how the people of Gotham have taken to characterizing it by the villains that reside in it. Some call it Two-Face, a city at odds with itself. Others call it Killer Croc, an animalistic monster.</p>
	<p>Batman lists off a couple other names that have been used to describe Gotham before refuting them. He states that Gotham won't ever be defined by its criminals because they are "cowardly and superstitious, ruled by predictable desires."</p>
	<p>The fight continues until Batman is thrown from a window and outside of the building. He faces the criminals boldly while Joker sinisterly emerges from the shadows behind him, only to greet him like an old <a href="three.html">friend.</a></p>
