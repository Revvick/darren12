	<p>Later on, Batman sits in the Batcave while making small talk with the Joker, who stands close by. After a few moments Batman addresses Joker as Dick before ordering him to take off a special mask. The Joker obliges, and removes a high tech disguise that reveals him to actually be Dick Grayson, AKA Nightwing.</p>
	<p>The two of them then make their way to a party going on in Wayne Manor. On the way, they bump into Damian Wayne and Tim Drake, Batman's son and former apprentice <a href="five.html">respectively.</a></p>
