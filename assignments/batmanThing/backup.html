	<p>The story opens up with Batman confronting a group of rioting inmates at arkham asylum. The battle begins while an internal monologue commences. In it, Batman begins a disscusion about what Gotham "is." </p>

	<p>As the fight progresses, he mentions how the people of Gotham have taken to characterizing it by the villains that reside in it. Some call it Two-Face, a city at odds with itself. Others call it Killer Croc, an animalistic monster.</p>
	<p>Batman lists off a couple other names that have been used to describe Gotham before refuting them. He states that Gotham won't ever be defined by its criminals because they are "cowardly and superstitious, ruled by predictable desires."</p>
	<p>The fight continues until Batman is thrown from a window and outside of the building. He faces the criminals boldly while Joker sinisterly emerges from the shadows behind him, only to greet him like an old friend.</p>

	<p>After asking if he is ready, Batman reengages the inmates alongside Joker. Together, they beat them down. As this happens the monologue talks about how recently people have taken to defining Gotham as being Batman, or Batmans city.</p>
	<p>The story jumps ahead to a meeting between Batman and Commisioner Gordon. Gordon asks Batman about the riot and what started it and he explains that a guard named Matthews was corrupt and released the inmates in order to stop Batman from apprehending him.</p>
	<p>When Gordon asks Batman how he found out Matthews was corrupt batman replies by saying that he had a man on the inside.Gordon makes a remark about how there's how he figures that everyone is corruptable, but Batman disagrees with the statement. When Gordon asks about whether or not Batman really was working with the Joker to fight the inmates (he saw the fight via security footage) Batman tells him that he didn't.</p>

	<p>Later on, Batman sits in the Batcave while making small talk with the Joker, who stands close by. After a few moments Batman addresses Joker as Dick before ordering him to take off a special mask. The Joker obliges, and removes a high tech disguise that reveals him to actually be Dick Grayson, AKA Nightwing.</p>
	<p>The two of them then make their way to a party going on in Wayne Manor. On the way, they bump into Damian Wayne and Tim Drake, Batman's son and former apprentice respectively.</p>

	<p>We soon after catch up to what is actually the present, and it turns out that the monologue that had been going on up until this point was actually a speech Batman had been delivering to a room full of investors as Bruce Wayne. In it, Wayne states that trying to identify what Gotham "is" is meaningless since all anyone will ever do is project their own problems or issues onto it. He instead encourages everyone to look to the future and ask themselves what Gotham can be. He encourages the investors to put money towards renovating some of the most run down portions of Gotham City.</p>

	<p>After the speech Wayne mingles with the investors. As he does this Alfred compliments him for the speech before mentioning how Wayne will be building several Hideouts for to use as Batman while working to upkeep the city.</p>

	<p>Wayne is introduced to a man named Lincoln March, who is currently running for Mayor. The two talk about how they can support one another, while Wayne eavedrops on a phone call Commisioner Gordon is making nearby. He gets word of a violent murder and after agreeing to meet with March on another day he leaves the party to view the scene of the crime as Batman.</p>

	<p>Batman arrives at the crime to work alongside a police man named Harvey to figure out whats going on. They enter an apartment to find a body riddled with knives. After assessing it for a bit, they find out that the killer is going after Bruce Wayne next.</p>
	<p>Harvey makes a remark about how the circumstances almost make him feel bad for Wayne and when asked to elaborate he explains how people like Wayne don't get how Gotham works like him and Batman, and that he can talk about what Gotham is, and was, and will be all he wants but that it truely is a mystery above anything else. As this is said Batman gets a call from Alfred  that traces a DNA sample in the crime scene belonging to Dick Grayson, suggesting that he could somehow be the killer.</p>
